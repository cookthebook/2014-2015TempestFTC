Datalogging:
1. Holds all programs associated with/uses datalogging
2. Will hold .xlsx (or .xls) files for smaller datalog stuff
3. MS Access databases will be made for things like motor and battery data. I will most likely be managing this unless someone else can use it. If you do not have/cannot use Access, I will also post more readable data in this directory
