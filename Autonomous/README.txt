Autonomous:
1. Obviously will hold the autonomous programs themselves
2. Will also hold and strategy/brainstorming text documents, excel sheets, data (NOT databases), etc. If you make a new file that it is not a program, PLEASE use .txt, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .c, or blank document file types (aka use MS Office, RobotC, or Notepad).
