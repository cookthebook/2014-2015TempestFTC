===================

All documentation of the 2014-2015 season for 6699, Tempest

This repository is in existence to allow several members of the team to edit the same code and the progression over the months we have made with the code. Whenever you make any change to code, whether it be new code or editing existing, give a useful description of the commit, you do not necessarily have to comment on the program. The GitHub repo will also be very useful as it is sort of automatically filling out a programming section of a notebook, as long as we use nice descriptions for the commits. Do NOT be afraid to edit code, we can always revert. But if you ever want to make a new program, start it in Test Files, then move it to the respective section. If you need a new section, talk to me about it, but I seriously doubt we'll ever need to do that.


NOTE: If a change has been made to the README, please take the time to check what the change is!

Autonomous:
1. Obviously will hold the autonomous programs themselves
2. Will also hold and strategy/brainstorming text documents, excel sheets, data (NOT databases), etc. If you make a new file that it is not a program, PLEASE use .txt, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .c, or blank document file types (aka use MS Office, RobotC, or Notepad).

Teleop:
1. Same rules and ideas as Autonomous, except for Teleop files
2. This directory is less likely to be used frequently, as teleops are rather simple

Datalogging:
1. Holds all programs associated with/uses datalogging
2. Will hold .xlsx (or .xls) files for smaller datalog stuff
3. MS Access databases will be made for things like motor and battery data. I will most likely be managing this unless someone else can use it. If you do not have/cannot use Access, I will also post more readable data in this directory

Test Files:
1. Please use this to experiment, don't be afraid!
2. If you ever want to create a new program, put it in here and then test it. If the program remotely does what you want, move it to the respective directories, keep this one clean

To the Knights/other FTC teams:
1. Feel free to read our programs and get ideas from it
2. If you want to copy a few lines of code, like an algorithm, this code is under a Creative Commons license. So yes, you CAN use the code, just comment in the program who and where you got the lines
